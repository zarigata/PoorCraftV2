# Placeholder for Windows icon file
# This should be replaced with an actual .ico file containing multiple resolutions
# For now, this is a text placeholder to establish the file structure
# 
# To create a proper .ico file:
# 1. Design icons at 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 pixels
# 2. Use a tool like ImageMagick, GIMP, or online converter
# 3. Combine all sizes into a single .ico file
# 4. Replace this file with the actual binary .ico file
