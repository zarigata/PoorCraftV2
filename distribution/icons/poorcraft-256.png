# Placeholder for Linux icon file
# This should be replaced with an actual 256x256 PNG file
# For now, this is a text placeholder to establish the file structure
# 
# To create a proper PNG icon:
# 1. Design a 256x256 pixel icon
# 2. Save as PNG with transparency (alpha channel)
# 3. Optimize the file size if needed
# 4. Replace this file with the actual binary PNG file
