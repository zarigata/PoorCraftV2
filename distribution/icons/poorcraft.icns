# Placeholder for macOS icon file
# This should be replaced with an actual .icns file containing multiple resolutions
# For now, this is a text placeholder to establish the file structure
# 
# To create a proper .icns file:
# 1. Design icons at various sizes (16x16 to 512x512, including @2x versions)
# 2. Use iconutil on macOS or a third-party tool
# 3. Create an iconset directory with all required sizes
# 4. Convert to .icns using: iconutil -c icns YourIconset.iconset
# 5. Replace this file with the actual binary .icns file
